# Programming Workshop

## Getting Started

### Installations

1. Install a package manager. I personally prefer Anaconda, but have used both of the following at some time or another:

    - [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
    - [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
To keep everyone on the same page, I'll be using Anaconda for this workshop since it supports a wider range of operating systems.
